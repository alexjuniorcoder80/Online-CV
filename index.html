        <h3>Professional experience</h3>
        <h4>Snowdrop Independent Living, Penarth</h4>
        <h5>Marketing and Customer Service Assistant</h5>
        <p>A combined role, covering both customer services and assisting with the marketing activity 
        for the Snowdrop Independent Living group. During a 2 month period of transition between Marketing Managers, 
        I was required to step up to fulfil additional duties for the senior management team, 
        which included working with external agencies, preparing a monthly board report using 
        analytical skills and managing in house systems to enable a smooth transition between 
        marketing managers. At times the business needs were such that I was required to work in 
        various retail branches on a temporary basis. This gave me a deeper understanding of 
        key customer segments.
        </p>

    <h3>Work Experience and Volunteering</h3>
    <h4>Vita Health Group, London</h4>
    <p>Working at a medium sized healthcare company in South East London to help with a rebrand. 
    Responsibilities included updating branding documents and physical signage and assisting the 
    marketing manager in organising photoshoots to promote the new brand. This helped to develop 
    attention to detail, ensuring branding is symmetrical and well placed, along with enhancing my 
    communication skills.</p>
